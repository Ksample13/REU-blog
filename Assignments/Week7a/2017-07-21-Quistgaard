## Chapter 13 
  
1. The reason why the writer says "provided strong evidence that using the busy road was quickest," instead of saying "I proved it" is because one cannot prove something that is constantly changing. Also one can't prove without data plus the outcome cannot be applied broadly.  

2. The reason why the small p-value wasn't much of a difference in travel time between the two routes home is because the p-values are for hypothesis testing and it allows research to narrow the possibilities. The p-values aren't error rates.  

3. Statistics is used for the collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data 
  
## Chapter 14 
  
1. We say the probability of the data under the null hypothesis because the null hypothesis is the same with no difference meaning its equal. Knowing the probability of the hypothesis given the data would be more interesting but we can't get the data without testing the hypothesis. 

2. These are examples of null hypotheses.  
    B) African American males have an equal chance of hailing a taxi as a white male. 
    C) New York hospitals have an average cesarean rate. 
    D) Patients taking new, less toxic type of chemotherapy has equal response rates as standard chemotherapy 
  
## Chapter 15  
  
1. A p-value of 0.049999 isn't always statistically significant and a p-value of 0.050001 isn't always never statistically significant. It depends on the sample size.  

2. The reason that the experiment with Michael Jordan resulted in a non-significant p-value is because the sample size wasn't large enough. 

4. The connection between a criminal trial and a p-value is Type 1 and Type 2 error. Type 1 error is an innocent person convicted of being guilty and type 2 is a guilty person found innocent.
