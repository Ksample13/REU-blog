## Background:

Read Chapters 13-15 of the book *What is a p-value anyway?* by Andrew Vickers. (Sam and Joe will have handed copies out already.) Respond to the circled discussion questions at the end of each chapter. Remember, length of response is not as important as how well and how clearly you communicate your well-formed thoughts in the response. Please avoid run-on sentences. You may use the outline below to frame your responses. Try to respond in such a way so that the reader can tell what the question was without having to write the question out before your answer.

## Chapter 13
1. There are other influences, such as; pleasure and quality of life that were not accounted for. 


2. Because the sample size was large. 


3. When utilizing a hypothesis test a conclusion is necessary but not a call to action. 


## Chapter 14


1. This question doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me it looks like: H0: P(data) vs . P(H0|data)
The data is always included so I don’t know why you’d say given the data. 


2. B. H0: African American Males = White Male
     Ha: African American Males < White Male

   C. H0: NY = Avg Rates
     Ha: NY > Avg Rates

   E. H0: Less Toxic = Standard Chemo
     Ha: Less Toxic ≤ Standard Chemo
     
     

## Chapter 15

	
1. Depends on sample size (n). 


2. Sample size of free throws wasn’t large enough. 	


3. Type I and Type II errors.
